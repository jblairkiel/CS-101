#UA-CS-101

My Spring 2014 CS-101 with Dr. Dixon.  This was a preview class for the dreaded CS-201 class, Data Structures and Algorithms.  This class was implemented in C++, which was challenging and rewarding.  

##Project1

Project 1 is a nice practice for reading in text, parseing, cleaning and counting words.  I can't remember how I initially implemented this project, but currently I have a Hashtable that is WAY overkill for a project as simple as this.  However it was an already available datastructure that was easy and quick to throw in.

The program takes a text file as an argument.

To compile and run
```
>>make
>>./project1 sample.txt	
```

or 

```
>>make run
```
